# Spawn - General Purpose Mod for Green Hell

## Usage

* **spawn Help** - this will export HelpText to `SpawnHelp.txt` on desktop (with commands and all item ids)
* **spawn Log** - switches logging to `SpawnLog.log` on desktop (off by default)
* **spawn UnlockNotepad** - this will unlock the whole notepad (crafting, recipes, info...)
* **spawn [id]** - this will spawn the item with the corresponding [id]
* **spawn [id] [quantity]** - this will spawn multiples of the item, only applicable to items that can be places inside the backpack.
* **spawn [id] rm** - this will destroy all items with that [id] in radius of 5 (approximately 2.5 meters/yards)
* **spawn [id] rm [maxDistance]** - this is same as last one but can configure distance
* **spawn [id] rm debug** - this will list all found items with their positions and distances but **NOT REMOVE THEM**
* **spawn [specialWeapon]** - this will spawn an existing weapon but with modified stats

### Special Weapons

* `First_Blade` - this will look like the Obsidian_Bone_Blade, but will have near infinite durability and will kill/destroy every object with one strike/throw.
* `Lucifers_Spear` - this will look like the Obsidian_Spear, but will be able to kill any enemy/animal with one strike/throw.

Those weapons are inspired by the **Supernatural** TV show.

And now you too will have a weapon that can kill any living being (angels and demons included).
